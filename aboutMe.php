			I grew up in a small town near Sofia, Bulgaria and I have lived 
			there for 17 years and then I moved in the capital. I have studied in my home town untill I 
			graduated 7<sup>th</sup> grade. Then I became 2<sup>nd</sup> at the National Biology Olimpics and started studying at the 
			<strong><abbr title="National High School of Nature Sciences and Mathmatics">
			NHSNSM</abbr> "<abbr title="academic">acad.</abbr> Lyubomir Chakalov"</strong> with biology.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I graduated I decided not to continue with my biology education because I had lost interest
			over the years. Although I was good at chemistry, I took a look at the language sciences, because I
			was lazy and I didn't wanted to study. So I started university as a Bulgarian filologist and at the moment 
			I am at my 3<sup>rd</sup> year of my bachelor education. Between my 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> 
			I have spent a whole year studying chemistry. Then I thought that this was the right thing to do an that
			It is better and more interesting than the bulgarian filology and it was my intention to finish my bachelor 
			education as chemist.

			 But then a friend of mine made me go to a programming basics course with C# and I that is how 
			I got involved with programming. If it was'n for him I'd never go on such thing. I used to think that programming
			is not for me because of bad memories from my programming classes at school. Eventually I saw that there is nothing 
			scary about programming and soon I started Season 6 at the IT Talents course where I was able to manage with most of the given tasks.
			And that's how I got into coding. The course was intense and I coudn't make it till the end. But I didn't give up. I tried 
			one more time and now I may be the second best cadet in the PHP course.

			Meanwhile I have had several jobs. I have worked as a direct sales consultant to a internet company.
			After that I was a cashier in a supermaket. I also have small experience with making interviews by the telephone.
			Currently I wash the dishes in a hotel in the center of the city, but soon I hope to start work as a programmer.
